# nim

Submission for my Advanced Higher Computer Science Project in 2017.

.NET C# framework implementation of the coin game "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">nim</a>" developed with Visual Studio.

The code commentary is a bit over the top but it was a requirement of the course. Also appologies for the line length.

## to run

Get the binary from this repo as `Nim.exe`.

* Windows: Just double click the exe. Or `./Nim.exe` from the command line.
* Linux:
	* `mono Nim.exe` with <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">mono</a>.
	* `wine Nim.exe` with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">wine</a> and <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Mono">wine-mono</a>
* MacOS: probably the same as linux.

Note that the binary will create some CSV files for the leaderboards in the directory it's ran in.

## build instructions

... are beyond me.

You can probably build it from Visual Studio in Windows but command line instructions elude me.

I don't care to install Windows Visual Studio so the original binary is provided.
